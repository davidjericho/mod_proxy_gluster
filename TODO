TODO

  These are some items that need improvement. The list is likely not
  exhaustive, nor in a particular order.

  Patches, suggestions and other things can be send to the author and/or the
  Gluster Developers Discussion List. Email addresses are in the main README.


- see the TODO comments in mod_proxy_gluster.c
- use auto-tools for building, see mod_nss for a possible way, update README
- verify the ap_proxyerror() calls
- security checks of the code
- make the code more readable, use smaller functions etc...
- filtering directory entries (like '*.tar.gz') does not work
- make logging by libgfapi work, add config option for filename and loglevel
- review the logging with ap_log_rerror()
- find out if/how mod_proxy can be used in combination with mod_php and all
